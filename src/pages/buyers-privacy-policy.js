                    <p>
                        Personal data is any information that relates to an
                        identified or identifiable living individual (e.g.,
                        name, surname, home or email address, IP address, cookie
                        ID, location data, T.I.N. etc.). Different pieces of
                        information, which collected together can lead to the
                        identification of a particular person, also constitute
