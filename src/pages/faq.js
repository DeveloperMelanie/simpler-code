                <p>
                    1. You click on the Simpler Quick Buy button that you see on
                    a store, website, ad or social media platform
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. You save your basic information during your first
                    transaction with a seller within the Simpler network. No
                    password is needed. Info is saved once and then never asked
                    again.
                </p>
                <p>3. Thatâ€™s it! Your order is on its way.</p>
                <p>
                    4. Any time you see the Simpler Quick Buy button again, on
                    any website, your information is saved so you don't have to
                    enter it again.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What happens if I already have an account with Simpler and
                    want to checkout from a new device?
                </h3>
            </Document>
        </Layout>
    )
